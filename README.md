# string-search-and-count
Simple repo to show searching dataframe for instances of a string or on of many strings


Does pretty much what it says on the tin.  Searches a column in a data frame and filtering if it contains a single string anywhere in a longer string or feeding in a multiple search where searching for an instance of any of a vector of search terms.  For bonus points have included how to add a flag or count of instances.
